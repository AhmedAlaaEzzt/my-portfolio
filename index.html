    <h2>I'm a Web Developer</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my portfolio website!</p>
    <p>
      I'm a React developer with a strong focus on building interactive and
      responsive web applications. My core skills include React, TypeScript, and
      CSS, complemented by experience with styling frameworks like Tailwind,
      Bootstrap, and Ant Design. Additionally, I have experience working with
      the ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript, allowing me to integrate advanced
      mapping features into web applications. Iâ€™m committed to delivering
      high-quality, visually appealing, and functional solutions.

    <h3>YouTube Channel Playlists</h3>
    <p>
      Alongside my development work, I run a YouTube channel where I share
      curated playlists covering various topics in web development and software
      engineering. These playlists include tutorials, project walkthroughs, and
      tips for mastering tools and frameworks like React, TypeScript, and CSS
      frameworks. My goal is to provide valuable resources for developers at all
      levels, helping them build practical skills through hands-on content.
