          I'm a React developer with a strong focus on building interactive and
          responsive web applications. My core skills include React, TypeScript,
          and CSS, complemented by experience with styling frameworks like
          Tailwind, Bootstrap, and Ant Design. Additionally, I have experience
          working with the ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript, allowing me to
          integrate advanced mapping features into web applications. Iâ€™m
          committed to delivering high-quality, visually appealing, and
          functional solutions.

      <p>
        Alongside my development work, I run a YouTube channel where I share
        curated playlists covering various topics in web development and
        software engineering. These playlists include tutorials, project
        walkthroughs, and tips for mastering tools and frameworks like React,
        TypeScript, and CSS frameworks. My goal is to provide valuable resources
        for developers at all levels, helping them build practical skills
        through hands-on content.
